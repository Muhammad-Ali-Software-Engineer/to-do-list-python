# File-Based To-Do List App 📝

A simple Python console application for managing tasks. This app allows you to:

- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Delete tasks
- Automatically save tasks to a file (`to-do.txt`)
- Load tasks on program start

---

## Features

1. **Add Task**: Enter a task and it will be saved to your list.
2. **View Tasks**: See all your tasks with their numbers.
3. **Delete Task**: Remove a task by its number.
4. **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in a text file, so they remain after closing the program.

---

## How It Works

- On start, the program checks if a `to-do.txt` file exists. If yes, it loads the tasks.
- When you add or delete tasks, the file updates automatically.
- Tasks are displayed with a number, making it easy to delete the correct one.
